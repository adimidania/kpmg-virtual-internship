# KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Program

This repository contains my submission for the Data Analytics Program offered by KPMG Australia, which is designed to demystify big data and teach individuals how to achieve business outcomes with the KPMG data analytics team.

## Task 01 - Data Quality Assessment

The first task involved assessing the quality and completeness of the data to prepare it for analysis. Using Python libraries Pandas and Numpy, I identified issues and provided a solution through an email.

## Task 02 - Data Insights

For the second task, I utilized Python to conduct RFM clustering on customer data, allowing me to target high-value customers based on their demographics and attributes.

## Task 03 - Data Insights and Presentation

For the third task, I created visualizations using PowerBI to convey the insights gained from the data analysis. Although the fully interactive dashboard allows the user to view the properties of each segment, I have only included the PDF version in this repository due to technical difficulties.
